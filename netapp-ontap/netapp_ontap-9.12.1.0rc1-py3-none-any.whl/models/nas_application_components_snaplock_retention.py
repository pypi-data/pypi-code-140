The retention value represents a duration and must be specified in the ISO-8601 duration format. The retention period can be in years, months, days, hours, and minutes. A duration specified for years, months, and days is represented in the ISO-8601 format as quot;Plt;num&gt;Y&quot;, &quot;P&lt;num&gt;M&quot;, &quot;P&lt;num&gt;D&quot; respectively, for example &quot;P10Y&quot; represents a duration of 10 years. A duration in hours and minutes is represented by &quot;PT&lt;num&gt;H&quot; and &quot;PT&lt;num&gt;M&quot; respectively. The retention string must contain only a single time element that is, either years, months, days, hours, or minutes. A duration which combines different periods is not supported, for example &quot;P1Y10M&quot; is not supported. Apart from the duration specified in the ISO-8601 format, the duration field also accepts the string &quot;infinite&quot; to set an infinite retention period and the string &quot;unspecified&quot; to set an unspecified retention period.
