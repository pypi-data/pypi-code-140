ONTAP home directory functionality automatically offer each user a dynamic share to their home directory without creating an
individual SMB share for each user.
The ONTAP CIFS home directory feature enable us to configure a share that maps to
different directories based on the user that connects to it. Instead of creating a separate shares for each user,
a single share with a home directory parameters can be created.
In a home directory share, ONTAP dynamically generates the share-name and share-path by substituting
%w, %u, and %d variables with the corresponding Windows user name, UNIX user name, and domain name, respectively. """
